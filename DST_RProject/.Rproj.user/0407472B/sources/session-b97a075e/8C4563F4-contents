# Preprocessing Steps

First I need to determine when the different indicators are 0, low, or high. I will do this by normalizing the data that is relevant for these indicators. (For now I will ignore the columns that will act as validators until I am estimating the drilling state machine.)

1. Flow?
2. Rotation
  a. RT_RPM.W
  b. MR_RPM-AVG.MR
3. Vibration (rescaling)
  a. MR_VIBA.MR
  b. MR_VIBL.MR
  c. PD_Axial Vibration
  d. PD_Lateral Vibration
4. Rate of Penetration
  a. RT_ROP
5. Weight on Bit
  a. RT_WOB
